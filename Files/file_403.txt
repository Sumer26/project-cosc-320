But last in the lineup was a surprise appearance from Hillary Clinton, who apparently took a break from walking her dog in the woods or whatever to read about the president's "longtime fear of being poisoned" and his weird obsession with McDonald's.Advertisement"That's it, we've got it, that's the one," Corden said."You think so?" Clinton asked. "The Grammy's in the bag?"Clinton was ostensibly hoping to win her second Grammy award for Best Spoken Word Album, after taking one home back in 1997. In the end, though, it was Carrie Fisher who won the award posthumously for her memoir The Princess Diarist.For what it's worth, Corden might have done better by just having Cardi B read the whole thing."If Trump was not having his 6:30 dinner with Steve Bannon, then more to his liking he was in bed by that time with a cheeseburger," the singer read. "Why am I even reading this shit? I can't believe this. I can't believe that he really… this how he lives his life?"Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.Follow Drew Schwartz on Twitter.Related: Yesterday on the Internet: The Grammys Get PoliticalTagged:NewsCultureEntertainmentGrammysfire and furyHillary ClintonCardi BDJ KhaledcherJohn LegendSNOOP DOGGvgtrnTrumpPoliticsjames CordenSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
