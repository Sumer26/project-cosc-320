Nike Screwed Up Big Time

DID THEY DO THAT?!

TMZSports.com





Jaleel White thinks Nike just blew it with Steph Curry ... saying mispronouncing the MVP's name -- calling him someone from White's hit show "Family Matters"-- was a $14 BILLION MISTAKE.


We got White leaving Craig's in L.A. and asked him about the reports that Curry soured on the honchos at the swoosh when a Nike rep called him "Steph-on" instead of Stephen.


Jaleel knows the name ... it was the same moniker he used playing the "cool" version of Steve Urkel back in the '90s and while it worked getting Laura's attention ... it was a DISASTER for Nike.


Check out the clip ... and witness the pure swag of Stefan Urquelle below.
