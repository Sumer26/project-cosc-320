According to Reuters, a senior Republican lawmaker claims there are currently 40 “No” votes in the House. Assuming no Democrat is going to vote in favor, Republicans could afford only 21 dissentions if the bill is to pass and move on to the Senate, where it also faces considerable opposition.North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said the bill would “absolutely not” pass in its current form.More moderate Republicans also have issues with the bill. Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick said in a Facebook post Saturday night that while he believes the Affordable Care Act is “broken,” he wouldn’t vote for the Republican bill in its current form, citing its impact on the “single most important issue plaguing” his constituents, “opioid abuse prevention, treatment and recovery.”The bill is still scheduled to be brought to the floor for a vote on March 23.Tagged:Affordable Care Actamerican health care actbrian fitzpatrickmark meadowsobamacarepaul ryanVICE NewsSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
