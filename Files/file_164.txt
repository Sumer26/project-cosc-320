Have you ever considered the points of intersection between early video art and psychotherapy? No? Well, why not start this weekend, with a program exploring the topic at EFA Project Space.
“Surrounded by Me” looks at the adoption of video in the 1970s in both artistic and clinical psychotherapy practices. As the event’s organizers, artist Tyler Coburn and art historian Robin Simpson, write: “Where Nancy Holt utters, ‘I am surrounded by me’ in Boomerang (1974), as she negotiates the echoes of her voice fed back through a headset, so a colleague of [psychotherapist Milton M.] Berger’s, facing a fleet of cameras and monitors, remarks, ‘I feel surrounded by myself.’” The primary connection there, Coburn and Simpson argue, is narcissism, and the way it played out in these fields and across our larger society.
In an attempt to investigate this overlap, and perhaps others, the pair has planned an evening and an afternoon of presentations and screenings at EFA. On Saturday, pediatrician Felix Rietmann, cultural historian Judith Rodenbeck, and Simpson himself will speak. On Sunday, video psychotherapy training tapes from the 1970s will share a lineup with artworks by Richard Serra and Nancy Holt, Howardena Pindell, Sadie Benning, Coburn, and others. The potential for cross-disciplinary conversation and discovery here is rich and intriguing.
 
 

When: Saturday, March 18, 5–7pm; Sunday, March 19, 2–6pm
Where: EFA Project Space (323 West 39th Street, 2nd Floor, Garment District, Manhattan)
