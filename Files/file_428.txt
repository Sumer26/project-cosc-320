(Reuters) - The bribery case against U.S. Senator Bob Menendez survived a key test on Monday, as the federal judge overseeing his trial rejected a defense motion to throw out the most serious charges.U.S. District Judge William Walls in Newark, New Jersey, allowed the trial to proceed on all charges.
