                        Thomson Reuters
                        
                        


                        
                      The Chinese Renminbi (CNY) is the worst performing Asian currency this year, down 5.67% versus the USD (Fig. 1a & 1b). This marks the third year of declines with the red-back hitting an 8 year low. The pace of depreciation has actually increased in recent months with the currency lower by 1.94% in November this year as investors accelerate capital outflows to take advantage of better offshore opportunities whilst avoiding low onshore rates and further depreciation. In response, the government has introduced new capital controls and strengthened enforcement of existing ones. The combination of a weaker currency and new controls is creating significant challenges for Renminbi cash investors.

BackgroundOne of the key steps towards capital account liberalization and Special Drawing Right (SDR) inclusion was loosening control of the currency. This was also a key trigger for other important on-shore reforms including interest rate liberalization and bond market reforms – which are now almost completed.However, ever since the CNY peaked at 6.04 against the USD in early 2014, the currency has been weakening. A combination of slower domestic growth and falling interest rates were the key reason for the depreciation following eight uninterrupted years of appreciation between 2005 and 2013.The pace of currency decline increased rapidly in August 2015 following the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) badly communicated “one-off” devaluation. Meanwhile, the YTD performance of the CNY is the worst in 22 years and investors expect further depreciation in 2017.Impact of current devaluationFaster capital outflows (FX reserves are down 873 billion since their June 2016 peak) have worried the government and reluctantly forced the PBoC to strengthen capital controls. However these tools are much less effective due to previous market liberalization steps and investors finding new ways to circumvent the rules.The capital outflows are also having a significant impact on domestic market liquidity. While a reserve requirement ratio cut would typically be used to support liquidity, the PBoC has refrained from cutting rates as this would be regarded as a further devaluation signal. Instead, the PBoC has focused on using open market operations (OMO) to ensure adequate liquidity.Total OMO outstanding recently hit a record high of over CNY 6 trillion. However, the PBoC is reluctant to increase this further as investors (bond funds and banks) have used the cheap and stable liquidity to leverage up wealth management, bond fund and trust products to boost returns (we hear anecdotally of leverage ratios of 4x to 6x), which has generated huge inflows into these asset classes, but also triggered concerns about the stability of the financial system.Recently, to discourage further leverage, the PBoC has increased repo funding costs – which has tightened onshore liquidity conditions (Fig 2), negatively impacted the equity and property markets and caused even more bond market volatility.

But on a positive note…However, it is worth noting the following factors: Firstly, there is little sign of panic in on-shore or off-shore bond and currency markets – helped by better communication by the central bank, compared to the surprise devaluation in August 2015.Secondly, USD strength has been a key trigger for CNY weakness, with the dollar stronger against most currencies amid expectations of rate hikes and fiscal stimulus.Finally, the new basket of currencies that the PBoC is targeting (CFETS index) has remained broadly steady over the past few months (Fig. 3).

ConclusionCurrency weakness, capital outflows and rate volatility are likely to persist in the near term. This will create challenges for the PBoC in managing the pace of depreciation while encouraging a reduction in system-wide leverage. So expect further negative headlines and even tighter capital controls.However, we believe the PBoC is much more experienced, better at communicating and has a broader range of tools available than in August 2014 or July 2013, which should hopefully help the central bank manage these conflicting goals.
