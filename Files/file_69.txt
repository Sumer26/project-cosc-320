Vjeran Pavic for Re/code




Summer’s almost here — but before you start Instagramming up the barbecue, wouldn’t it be nice to declutter all the technology in your life?
It can be hard to know where to start. Luckily, there’s the newest episode of Too Embarrassed to Ask, in which Kara Swisher and Lauren Goode tell you everything you need to know about digital spring cleaning:
Kara and Lauren discuss strategies for tidying up overloaded email inboxes, apps you never use and gadgets that are gathering dust in your closet. They also share readers’ and listeners’ tips for digital cleanup, including the nuclear option: Delete everything!
Thank you to everyone who submitted questions and digital spring cleaning suggestions — remember that you can always send in questions about any topic to us by tweeting @LaurenGoode, @KaraSwisher or @Recode with the hashtag #AskRecode.

Help us celebrate nine years of Vox

      Since Vox launched in 2014, our audience has supported our mission in so many meaningful ways. More than 80,000 people have responded to requests to help with our reporting. Countless teachers have told us about how they’re using our work in their classroom. And in the three years since we launched the Vox Contributions program, tens of thousands of people have chipped in to help keep our unique work free. We’re committed to keeping our work free for all who need it, because we believe that high-quality explanatory journalism is a public good. We can’t rely on ads alone to do that. Will you help us keep Vox free for the next nine years by making a gift today?
