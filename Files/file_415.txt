Bayer ranks fifth in veterinary medicine, behind Zoetis ZTS.N, the former Pfizer unit, Elanco ELAN.N, unlisted Boehringer Ingelheim, which acquired animal health assets from Sanofi SASY.PA, and drugmaker Merck & Co MRK.N.

REUTERS/Ina Fassbender/File PhotoBayer will also seek a buyer for its 60-percent stake in German chemical production site services provider Currenta.All three possible transactions were previously flagged by Reuters.Its shares were down 0.8 percent in late trade.Markus Mayer, an analyst at Baader Helvea, said Coppertone and Dr. Scholl’s could fetch 1 billion euros and the Currenta stake could fetch 1.5 billion euros.Reckitt Benckiser RB.L and Procter & Gamble Co PG.N will likely be among the suitors for the consumer brands, said investment bankers, who asked not to be named.JOB CUTSUnder a cost cutting program that will also target synergies expected from the $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto, Bayer will cut around 12,000 of its 118,200 jobs worldwide.At the Consumer Health and Pharmaceuticals divisions, Bayer will take about 3.3 billion euros in impairments and write-offs the fourth quarter.Consumer Health brands acquired with the Merck & Co. and Dihon businesses will account for 2.7 billion euros of that, while about 600 million euros impairments and write-offs are due to a decision not to utilize a hemophilia drug factory in the German city of Wuppertal and to concentrate production in Berkeley, United States.The consumer healthcare unit, which sells non-prescription treatments, has faced falling revenues as U.S. consumers went from established drugstores to online shops, often switching to cheaper brands.In the first nine months of 2018, Bayer consumer health products’ sales declined by 0.4 percent when excluding currency swings, following a drop of 1.7 percent in the full year of 2017.The company said it was targeting core earnings per share of 6.80 euros in 2019, up from an expected 5.70 to 5.90 euros this year, with a 2022 target of around 10 euros, when discounting the effect of currency swings and portfolio changes.The group’s margin of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and special items over sales should increase to over 30 percent by 2022, up from 26.5 percent last year, it added.Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze; Editing by Keith Weir and Mark PotterOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
