Wants You To Know She's Not Madonna, Rihanna, Mariah or Ariana on "Powa"The London artist has shared a 10-second clip of the song via Twitter.by Noisey StaffFebruary 8, 2017, 9:57amShareTweetSnapFresh off the back of an announcement that she'll be rising to the lofty echelons of legends like Patti Smith and Yoko Ono to curate this year's Meltdown Festival at London's Southbank Centre, M.I.A. has teased new music via Twitter.   
The multi-disciplinary artist took to social media to preview a ten-second clip of a track titled "Powa," having previously shared a twenty-second clip of what appears to be the song's music video last week. "Powa" sees Maya rapping in her signature deliberate flow over a beat that feels like the bolshier big sister of "Bad Girls," apparently calling out a music industry that compares her to other (perhaps more media friendly) women, as she spits "I'm not Madonna, or Rihanna, or Mariah, or Ariana / I've been around in this world causing drama."   
In case there was any confusion about her point of view, M.I.A. has also shared the lyric sheet for the track. As well as the name-checks mentioned above, it also features the repeated line "I'm taking on the Tower," which is pretty much confirmed Trump shade. M.I.A. getting political, huh? Who'd have thought?
