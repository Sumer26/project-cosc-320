All bowls have conference tie-ins, but those are broken when conferences can't fill all of their slots. Here's a good look at the tie-in and selection process. Teams have to be at least 6-6 to make a bowl, but if there aren't enough 6-6 teams to fill all of the slots, 5-7 teams are selected based on their Academic Progress Rate.The projected Playoff—Alabama vs. Washington and Ohio State vs. Clemson—and national championship—Alabama vs. Ohio State— are the same as Week 6 and should still produce an incredible set of games. Other intriguing matchups: Texas A&M vs. Oklahoma, Florida State vs. Tennessee, Nebraska vs. Arkansas and, somehow, a Rose Bowl with Washington State.Tagged:HighlightsALABAMAbowl gamesclemsoncollege footballcollege football highlightscollege football playoffOhio StateWashingtonSportsVICE SportsSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
