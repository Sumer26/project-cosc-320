This year's Warlord album was the first sign, and now the abruptly released Frost God EP confirms that the king Sadboy still has a place in the world, if his appearance on Frank Ocean's Blonde didn't already.The 8-track project features the gentle single "Hennessy & Sailor Moon," an A$AP Ferg verse on "Crystal City," and some of the lushest, prettiest production that Lean's ever rapped on. It also has a song simply titled "Kirby," so there's that. Put some Arizona in your eggnog (actually, maybe don't), plug in your Playstation 1, and listen to Frost God below.Phil will always weep and wild out to DeviantArt-core indie rap. He's on Twitter.Tagged:sailor moonyung leanAsap FergSadboysKirbyfrost godemotional boysMusicNoiseySubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
