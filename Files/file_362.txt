Franklin's legacy—her openness about female sexuality, her embodiment of soul and R&B, and her steadfast dedication to her art—has influenced thousands of artists who have come after her, from Alicia Keys to Ariana Grande.Franklin was originally from Memphis, Tennessee. Born into a preacher's family, her earlier years were spent singing gospel music in church. As her career progressed, she became an icon for women of color during the Civil Rights movement, and her hit songs, from "Respect" to "I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Loved You)," became household staples and American classics, spawning other songs and lyrics inspired by her powerful style.On today's episode, Franklin fan and Tonic editor Rajul Punjabi sat down with Noisey editor-in-chief Eric Sundermann to honor the legendary singer.You can catch The VICE Guide to Right Now Podcast on Acast, Google Play, Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts.
