Russia said it was cutting the “deconfliction line,” a key communication channel between Moscow and Washington used to prevent mixed messages and avoid military collisions between the two powers.
The U.S.-led coalition’s actions were further complicated by Iran, which over the weekend launched strikes on ISIS targets in Eastern Syria — Iran’s first missile strikes into the country.
“As the Islamic State’s territory in Syria shrinks, the U.S. is increasingly being put in direct contact with Syria and its allies,” said Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal. “The U.S. must decide if it wants to continue to actively support its proxies in the Syria civil war. If it does, it will be in direct conflict with Russia, Iran, Syria, and hostile Shia militias.”
The U.S. has maintained its broadening military involvement in Syria is part of the global fight against ISIS, and has avoided engaging directly with the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad and the larger civil war playing out in Syria.
The last time Russia threatened to cut off the deconfliction line was in April, when the U.S. launched missiles at a Syrian airbase in what ultimately amounted to a warning shot in retaliation for Assad’s continued use of chemical weapons.Tagged:BASHAR AL-ASSADIslamic state of iraq and syriaU.S. syriaAssad regimeISISrussia-syriasyria airstrikessyria assadThe Islamic StateVICE NewsSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
