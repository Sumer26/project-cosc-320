It can be a swinging lurch in your belly, a goosebumps-creating shudder or the sense that someone's grabbed you by the shoulders and won't stop shaking you repeatedly – but, you know, in a good way.As an instrument, the human voice makes a light flicker on in our minds – its the recognition of empathy, the comfort of now-woolly memories of your parents speaking to you when you were a baby, the bristling discomfort of a raised voice or one choked with panic.AdvertisementBut it's something else entirely to be able to do that with instrumentals alone. We've already written about the grime instrumental and its legacy in a genre that's come to be defined by the spitting, cajoling, winking voices of its most-respected MCs and rappers. Then you have someone like Shredda, a producer who's been quietly layering the beats over which the likes of Jammer, Shorty, P Money and Footsie have rhymed in recent years.Shredda was responsible for the beats on both "A Fun One" and "Bags Under My Eyes", off P Money's 2015 album Money Over Everyone 2, and they're among the five songs he's putting out on his forthcoming Horrific Injustice EP. You can have a listen to it here now, before it's due to drop on Sunday 12 February."Listening to grime beats is something I enjoy doing," he tells us, "but unlike house music and dubstep, instrumental grime doesn't get as much attention – although it's the most diverse genre. This is something I want to change." And here's the way he plans to do it, with strings samples, beats that jump like popping candy and synths colliding over one another.Listen to the Horrific Injustice EP below:(Lead image courtesy of Shredda)Tagged:producerGrimeproductionNew musicListengrime instrumentalShreddaMusicNoiseySubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
