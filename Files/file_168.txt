Since World War Two, almost 69 million people globally have been forced to flee war and violence.The WHO’s conflict mental health study, published in The Lancet medical journal, was carried out by a team of researchers from the WHO, Australia’s Queensland University, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and Harvard University in the United States.It analyzed research from 129 studies and data from 39 countries published between 1980 and August 2017.Regions that have seen conflict in the last 10 years were included and mental illnesses were categorized as either mild, moderate or severe. Natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as Ebola, were not included.Overall in war zones, the average prevalence was highest for mild mental health conditions, at 13%. Around 4% of people living amid armed conflict had moderate mental health illness, and for severe conditions the prevalence was 5%.The study also found that rates of depression and anxiety in conflict settings appeared to increase with age, and depression was more common among women than men.The study was funded by the WHO, the Queensland Department of Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Ed OsmondOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
