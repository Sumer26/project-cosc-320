I live in a large city —Baltimore— and there are 22 of these kinds of places. The art in these places, for a city full of artists, is pathetic and provincial.  There are 3  world-class museums, 2 art schools, and zero galleries. But there’s the much-loved nuisance of ‘hand-crafted’ beer.

I also live in Baltimore, and while I think your count of artsy stores is low, if you haven’t found at least 22 real, white-wall, fine art galleries, you’re not looking.

Mmmm not so sure about that. There are beaucoup small exhibition spaces or bars/cafés where you can show, but precious few galleries of any white-wall note. There are, now, 6 that I can count as such; 3 private white-walled galleries, and MICA’s 3 or 4.  But you can’t show at MICA, so that leaves 3. 
“Gallery” doesn’t mean a place is actually a gallery, nor is the art fine. Yes, there are a couple valiant attempts in Baltimore. None that I’ve known of support themselves with a frame shop. That said, there’s no traffic; they’re labors of love. But hanging a shingle that says ‘art’ doesn’t change the fact that you’re a boutique.
 There is only one so-called blue-chipper hold-out from the years of yore with white walls, Gimaldis, and Grimaldis is very spotty about what and who he shows. Much of what he shows is kak. Maybe you were around when Ciscle had his gallery; that was top shelf. But he and 4 others went out of business because Baltimore is, well, provincial.  Grimaldis is not the god he’s thought to be and treated as.  If you’re referring to School 33, we could call that a ‘white-wall gallery’ if the term is taken loosely. Just because stuff is funky cool doesn’t make it art. If you’re referring to Goya, that’s not an art gallery. There are a couple boozhie stores in the Mill Center; that’s not art either. Creative Alliance is insular; white walls, but insular.
There are very good artists in Baltimore; they don’t get shown here because they/we won’t sell their/our work at only $200. There’s a broad support for art here, but it’s not a buying public, it’s just supporters and boosters, which is fine. Baltimore does suffer from the same problem that the article/cartoon talks about, and Washington DC is actually very little different!

How much does living near a large population metropolitan area(s) affect the artist and his/her ability to exhibit/sell art?
Side comment: The art market seems to be moving to either really inexpensive art or really expensive art…not much of a market in between.

This is rather cruel, really. Who are we to question how other artists make a living? Rent yourself a storefront and show your own art there, and think of being inclusive. Make your artistic life wherever you are, and help other artists make theirs…
