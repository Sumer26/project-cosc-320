Today’s Apple iPhone/iPad/MacBook/Apple Watch showcase will be livestreamed on Twitter for the first time. The company has been livestreaming its product announcements for years, but until now it has always tried to keep the show on its Safari browser. Apple will be running the stream through its Twitter account — which never tweets and only runs paid ads, so you can’t actually see anything on its profile page. Once you spot the ad on the Twitter page, you can “Like” it, which will get Apple to tweet updates at you about the event once it starts. Listen to Bloomberg’s Apple reporter Mark Gurman talk about Apple’s strategy with its new iPhones; follow Recode’s live coverage of the event, which begins at 10 am PT.

Facebook is building large-scale AI to help its content moderators, who can’t possibly look through every single image that gets posted on the enormous platform. Its machine-learning system, called Rosetta, is designed to help identify text in more than a billion images and videos daily, and then transcribe the words in a way that’s machine-readable. The social media giant said text extraction is being utilized to “automatically identify content that violates our hate-speech policy.” Facebook has also added 24 languages to its automatic translation services.

Verizon customers in its four 5G launch markets will be able to sign up for home internet service starting Thursday. Like other major cellphone providers, Verizon plans to launch 5G mobile phone service next year as a way to compete with cable and other providers with what’s known as fixed wireless service. The service will launch Oct. 1 in parts of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento. Meanwhile, the FCC told carriers Sprint and T-Mobile that it needs more time to review their proposed merger; in April, the companies said they wanted to cut costs and combine forces to develop a next-generation 5G network.

Gawker 2.0 is coming early next year. The reborn website is owned by Bryan Goldberg, founder and CEO of Bustle Digital Group, who in July was the winning bidder for the remaining assets of Gawker Media; he paid $1.35 million for the media gossip blog, which has been dormant since August 2016 after the company was sued into bankruptcy by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Goldberg has hired Amanda Hale as the new publisher of Gawker; she was chief revenue officer of the Outline, the culture website founded by Joshua Topolsky that recently laid off much its staff.

Newsroom jobs declined 23 percent over the past decade, with Google, Facebook and Amazon gobbling up most of the digital ad growth. But some publishers are staffing up, including the Atlantic, helped by funding from Laurene Powell Jobs’s Emerson Collective, which took a majority stake in the magazine last year. Business Insider plans to hire “dozens” more in its newsroom — the digital publication turned an unexpected profit this year after its ad and subscription businesses exceeded their revenue profits. Venture-backed BuzzFeed let go of nearly 120 people last year, but is now looking to fill 55 roles. Condé Nast and the Los Angeles Times are also hiring substantially. [Max Willens / Digiday]
Several high-profile cryptocurrency companies are forming the Blockchain Association — the first fully fledged lobbying group in Washington, D.C., to represent entrepreneurs and investors who are building off the technology behind bitcoin. Joining the initial push are Coinbase and Circle, which operate some of the world’s most popular virtual currency exchanges; investors Digital Currency Group and Polychain Capital are also among the founding members.

Trump has never tweeted about it, but the major sector creating jobs the fastest under his administration is the food-and-drink service industry. The number of jobs at cafes and specialty snack stores (like ice cream shops) grew by 12 percent, nearly twice the growth in the fast-food sector, which alone has created about 270,000 jobs. This is part of a long-term trend: Food-and-drink service jobs have accounted for an increasingly large share of the U.S. job market since 2000, which shows how most job market trends have little to do with any specific president’s policies.

Help us celebrate nine years of Vox

      Since Vox launched in 2014, our audience has supported our mission in so many meaningful ways. More than 80,000 people have responded to requests to help with our reporting.

And in the three years since we launched the Vox Contributions program, tens of thousands of people have chipped in to help keep our unique work free. We’re committed to keeping our work free for all who need it, because we believe that high-quality explanatory journalism is a public good. We can’t rely on ads alone to do that.
