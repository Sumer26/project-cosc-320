by Noisey StaffApril 4, 2016, 7:43pmShareTweetSnapThey've sold out Carnegie Hall, they've dazzled audiences all over New York City, and now, Tengger Cavalry is hitting the road. Formed by frontman and mult-instrumentalist Nature Ganganbaigal while he was still living back home in Beijing, the Tengger Cavalry project has grown far beyond its initial concept—a band meant to celebrate both Ganganbaigal's Mongolian roots and his love of heavy metal. The band has become a cultural force, and the release of its latest EP, Mountain Side, cements their status as one of North America's most dynamic and unique musical—let alone metallic—entities.Mountain Side features reworkings of older material (which incorporate Native American tribal music, Mongolian traditional folk, and cinematic filmscapes, in a nod to Ganganbaigal's day job as a composer), as well as a few new songs and remixes. The album is available here, and we're debuting the music video for the title track below.AdvertisementAs Ganganbaigal commented, “This is our very first music video, and it really represents the band's musical and cultural ideas behind the scene!Catch Tengger Cavalry on tour across the United States in May:5/14 – Naugatuck, CT @ Cooks Cafe
