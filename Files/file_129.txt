Man Ray, “Glass Tears (Les Larmes)” (1932), photograph, gelatin silver print on paper, 229 x 298 mm (collection Elton John, © Man Ray Trust/ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2016)
Art Movements is a weekly collection of news, developments, and stirrings in the art world.
Tate Modern will stage an exhibition of work from Elton John‘s photography collection in November. The Radical Eye: Modernist Photography from the Sir Elton John Collection will include over 150 works by artists including Man Ray, André Kertész, Berenice Abbott, and Alexandr Rodchenko.
Police are investigating gunshot damage inflicted on the exterior of the Schwules Museum*, an institution in Berlin dedicated to LGBT culture and history.
 
 

French police seized a painting attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder from the Caumont Centre d’Art in Aix-en-Provence after doubts were raised regarding its authenticity.
According to the Financial Times, as many as 240 staff members at Qatar Museums were laid off as part of a series of budget cuts implemented by the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

Christie’s will sell two early paintings by Tony O’Malley, which, when turned over and placed side by side, reveal an unfinished nude by Francis Bacon. The two artists were neighbors in St. Ives in the late 1950s. O’Malley cut the board that Bacon had used in half in order to produce “Currach, Clare Island” and “Evening Landscape Tehidy Hospital.” The paintings are estimated to fetch between £20,000–30,000 (~$) at Christie’s Modern British and Irish Art sale on March 17.
Cambridge University will consider repatriating a sculpture of a bronze cockerel after the Jesus College student union voted to return the work to Nigeria. “Okukor” was one of almost 1,000 bronzes plundered by British troops during the 1897 Benin Expedition.
According to Mikhail Piotrovsky, the director of the State Hermitage Museum, the British Museum purposely avoided shipping its recent loan of one of the Parthenon sculptures through Europe. “Greece believe that it belongs to them and they could have attempted to seize it at some airport en route,” Piotrovsky told The Art Newspaper.
The Walker Art Center will no longer host its wildly popular Internet Cat Video Festival. The museum will donate memorabilia from the festival’s four iterations to the Minnesota Historical Society.

A Brief Flowering, an exhibition of works by Welsh artist John Cyrlas Williams (1902–65), will open at the Oriel Plas Glyn-y-Weddw on March 20. In 2004, over 150 of Williams’ works were discovered in the attic of his family home in Porthcawl. Art historian Peter Lord told the BBC that the trove of artworks narrowly avoided destruction. “It turns out that the auctioneers had been clearing the house prior to sale, and that they were about to throw the whole lot on a bonfire in the back garden,” Lord told the BBC.
Aegean Airlines will sponsor Documenta 14, which is being co-hosted by Kassel and Athens, and operate flights between the two host cities.
