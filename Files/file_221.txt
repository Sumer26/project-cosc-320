It had never been done before.”The decision even caught the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who said on Twitter the disqualification of Maximum Security could only happen in “these days of political correctness”.West said he did see Maximum Security, who led from nearly start to finish, move over several lanes but felt such contact was inevitable given the number of horses allowed to race in the Kentucky Derby, which usually features 20 horses but this year had 19 year after a late scratch.“Churchill Downs, because they’re a greedy organization, has (20 horses) rather than 14 like you have in the Kentucky Oaks, the Breeders’ Cup, every other race in America,” said West.“Just because they can make more money, they’re willing to risk horses’ lives and peoples’ lives to do that. I’m not a fan of that. I think they ought to have 14 like every other race.,” said West.“Yes I saw the horse move out, but every Kentucky Derby, you could sit down two or three or four horses if you wanted to, because it’s like a rodeo out there.”When asked for comment, Churchill Downs Racetrack President Kevin Flanery said in an email to Reuters that the infraction by Maximum Security had nothing to do with the number of horses in the race and that there is no evidence to the contrary.West said there would be no rematch with Country House when Baltimore’s Pimlico Race Course hosts the Preakness Stakes.“We are not going to run The Preakness,” said West. “There’s no Triple Crown on the line for us, and no reason to run a horse back in two weeks when you don’t have to.”Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Additional reporting by Gabriella Borter; Editing by Bill Trott, Ed Osmond and Pritha SarkarOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
