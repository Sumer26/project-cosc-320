Welcome to the public markets, Snapchat.  
Stock for Snap, the company behind Snapchat, fell more than 12 percent Monday, just its third full day of trading. Snap stock finished the day at $23.77 per share, below the $24 opening price it garnered on IPO day last week. 
The dip appears to be tied to a number of poor analyst ratings, including five “sell” ratings, which is an unusually high number. 
The biggest concern around Snapchat appears to be tied to user growth. Snap has 158 million daily users but added just five million new users in Q4, a hefty decline from earlier in the year. 

  
Of course, Snap is far from doomed just three days into trading — the stock is simply settling after a crazy IPO rush. On IPO day last Thursday, the stock finished the day up 44 percent. It was up another 10 percent Friday, before dipping 12 percent Monday.

Help us celebrate nine years of Vox

      Since Vox launched in 2014, our audience has supported our mission in so many meaningful ways. More than 80,000 people have responded to requests to help with our reporting. Countless teachers have told us about how they’re using our work in their classroom. And in the three years since we launched the Vox Contributions program, tens of thousands of people have chipped in to help keep our unique work free. We’re committed to keeping our work free for all who need it, because we believe that high-quality explanatory journalism is a public good. We can’t rely on ads alone to do that. Will you help us keep Vox free for the next nine years by making a gift today?
