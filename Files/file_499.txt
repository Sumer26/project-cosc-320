Traditionally, young national players have been brutally dragged into the destructive hype machine of U.S. soccer (*cough* Freddy Adu *cough*), and the 21-year-old Jordan Morris is no different.The debate about whether a young U.S. player should develop his talents in a domestic or foreign league spiked after rumors emerged of Morris signing with Bundesliga side Werder Bremen. But on Thursday, Morris officially signed with his hometown Seattle Sounders. Cue USMNT fan base overreaction.Advertisement

Morris represents a bit of an anomaly: he's a talented non-professional American who has garnered the attention of a reputable European club, despite falling outside of the typical age range for European youth recruitment. Morris went to the Seattle Sounders FC Youth Academy for a year before signing a letter of intent to play for Stanford University. He was later brought up to play for the USMNT by Jurgen Klinsmann, a coach known for encouraging his players to play abroad. But despite earning the seal of approval from the USMNT German manager, it seems that whatever happened rubbed Werder Bremen coach Thomas Eichin the wrong way."We're in a situation now where we need players who fully identify with Werder and the way things are done here, in order for them to focus properly on the task ahead," Eichen said.Eichin later went on to tell Bild that Morris was "homesick." The Werder Bremen manager's comments are not a good look for American soccer players, who bear a reputation of being soft (*cough* Landon Donovan *cough*).But despite getting turned down by the more highly-regarded Bundesliga, pundits are saying that the move to the Sounders is solid. Not to mention the fact that reports are stating that it is the richest homegrown player contract in MLS history. Hard to tell what life Morris would have led to in Germany, but maybe a little under-hyped move could be beneficial to the young player.Tagged:HighlightsBundesligaClint Dempseyjordan morrisjurgen klinsmannseattle sounderssoccersoccer highlightsthomas eichenwerder bremenSportsVICE SportsSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
