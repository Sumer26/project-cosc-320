The security officers proceeded to pull his body down the length of the aircraft's walkway and off the flight.AdvertisementUnited's CEO Oscar Munoz responded by sending a letter to his employees that was leaked to the media. While Munoz said he was "upset to see and hear about what happened," he added that the passenger was "disruptive and belligerent."Ultimately, Munoz stood behind his employees, saying that the passenger refused to voluntarily leave the plane, with staff "left with no choice but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight."The airline earlier said that it was investigating what happened after videos of the incident provoked an angry response on social media.One of the passengers, Jayse D. Anspach, who posted a video of the incident to Twitter, has defended Dao. "#United overbooked and wanted four of us to volunteer to give up our seats for personnel that needed to be at work the next day," Anspach tweeted. "No one volunteered, so United decided to choose for us. They chose an Asian doctor and his wife. The doctor needed to work at the hospital the next day, so he refused to volunteer. Ten minutes later, the doctor runs back into the plane with a bloody face, clings to a post in the back, chanting, 'I need to go home.'"Ironically, the trade magazine PRWeek named Munoz 2017's "US Communicator of the Year" last March.Tagged:VICE UKfightflightunited airlinesapologyvgtrnChicago Police DepartmentpassengeroverbookingoverbookedOscar MunozSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
