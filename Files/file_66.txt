But they have one characteristic in common: Their views are openly white supremacist. Some even include limiting Jewish representation right in their political platforms or have the endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan.AdvertisementThe wannabe politicians, however, have tough campaigns ahead of them. Only 9 percent of Americans believe holding white supremacist or neo-Nazi views is acceptable, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted shortly after the violence in Charlottesville.That’s clear for Augustus Invictus, a Nazi candidate who ran for Florida Senate but dropped out because he couldn’t raise enough cash. He’s a white supremacist, Holocaust denier who once slaughtered a goat and drank its blood as part of a pagan ritual. He also headlined as a speaker at the violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.Arthur JonesJones’ campaign website pushes a document called “The ‘Holocaust’ Racket,” in which he calls the genocide of 6 million Jews during World War II “the biggest, blackest lie in history.”The 70-year-old longtime neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier won the GOP primary for Illinois’ 3rd Congressional District on Tuesday with more than 20,000 votes. But then again, he ran unopposed.“Even if only myself and my wife voted for me, I’d win the primary, because the Republican Party screwed up big-time,” Jones told the New York Times.This is Jones’ sixth run at the nomination, but this time the Republican Party just couldn’t get another candidate to oppose him. He’ll now be representing the GOP in November in a district that went Democrat in 24 of the last 25 elections.Good luck with that, Arthur.AdvertisementPaul NehlenNehlen once tweeted that all Jewish people will burn in hell and once told the former leader of the KKK David Duke’s podcast that “Jews control the media.”After campaigning for failed Senate candidate and accused child molester Roy Moore in Alabama, Nehlan’s now running to become the nominee to take Rep. Paul Ryan’s seat in Wisconsin. The next primary election is in August.Nehlen actually ran against Ryan once before, in Wisconsin’s last Republican primary in 2016 — and lost 85 percent to 15 percent. But not before receiving praise from President Donald Trump for supporting his presidency. At the time, Trump was facing criticism for his public fight with the Khans, the Muslim family of a Gold Star U.S. soldier killed in the Iraq War.Patrick LittleLittle self-identifies as a “white advocate” and is running for Senate in California. He’s currently outperforming fellow Republican contenders and has garnered the support of the KKK’s Duke.Little’s platform includes:
“Limiting representation of Jews in the government, to include judgeships, to number proportional to their percentage of the U.S. population.”
“Introduction of a bill to the Senate proposing the immediate dismissal of the necessary number of Jewish jurists that would reduce their representation in federal courts and the Supreme Court to a number representative of their percentage of the U.S. population.”
“Introduce legislation restoring the original intent of the Constitution, explicitly stating that the United States is an ethnically European nation.”
AdvertisementThe California Republican Party has disavowed Little — They even kicked him out of the GOP convention.“There's no room for that kind of hate speech that that man uses," Cynthia Bryant, executive director of the California Republican Party, told the Los Angeles Times.Little’s primary is on June 5, and if he wins, he’ll be facing incumbent Democratic Dianne Feinstein in November.John AbarrAbarr is all about diversity: In 2014, he tried to recruit black and LGBTQ people to the KKK, and now diversity is part of his platform as a candidate for the Montana state House of Representatives.But Abarr apologized for all of that — mostly.“I am writing to apologize to the citizens of Montana for promoting bigotry and hate against minorities,” Abarr wrote on his campaign website. “First of all, I would like to say that the whole Montana KKK group was just a hoax promoted by me. I created this hoax to infuse fear in the LGBTQ community and racial minorities in Montana.”Still, Abarr’s campaign website includes a call for European Americans to be declared a protected class.“There is widespread discrimination and hatred targeted at European Americans. There must be protections for us under the law,” his campaign website read. “Caucations [sic] should be able to publicly proclaim their ethnic identity and heritage in all institutions.” (The site spells caucasians incorrectly twice.)Tagged:Nazineo-naziRACISMJewishlistcongressmontanaCaliforniaIllinoiswisconsinAugustus Invictusarthur jonespatrick littleVICE NewsSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
