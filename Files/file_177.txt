Playing one of the greatest players of all time is a dream -- I’m excited to see how I do.”Even 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena, who usually gets too nervous watching sister Venus, is intrigued.“She’s so cool. She’s a great girl. I love her dad. They’re just really cool people,” Williams said on Saturday.“It’s a great moment for her and for Venus. She’s playing against a player that actually reminds me of Venus. I think I might, might watch. I always get nervous watching Venus.”Swiss great Roger Federer, whose management company Team 8 also looks after Gauff, is excited.“I’m super happy for her. I saw the last couple of games when she qualified. Obviously everybody was waiting to see what the draw was going to be like. I think that’s fascinating, that she plays Venus now,” he said.“It’s a great story. Coco is a nice girl, works really hard. I think she’s got a wonderful future ahead of her.”Gauff, who won the French Open junior title aged 14, is coached by her father Corey who once played college basketball for Georgia State. Her mother Candi was a college gymnast.“I feel blessed because my parents never put limitations on my goals,” Gauff said at Roehampton this week. “My parents always told me to shoot as high as I wanted to.”Venus could be excused for feeling her age a little as she walks out to face a player 24 years her junior but Gauff does not regard her as old.“I don’t think of Venus as old -- she’s still killing the game right now,” she said.Reporting by Martyn Herman; editing by Clare FallonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
