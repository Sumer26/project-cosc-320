Thanks Future!   
To promote the record, Future took part in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, because since Kanye West's landmark sit-down with the broadcaster for a chat about Yeezus back in 2013, that tends to be what you do when you release an Important Album. Interestingly, Future includes no features (indeed, he announced this via a tweet which read "NO FEATURES"), and sees the Atlanta rapper, as he told Lowe, "just focused on creatively coming out with something special on my own."
