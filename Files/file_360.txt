                      CBL Properties is taking a stand against Black Friday creep.



For the second year in a row, the mall operator that manages 62 malls across the country will close all of its locations for the entirety of Thanksgiving Day, according to a letter from its CEO, Stephen Lebovitz.Lebovitz told CNBC that his company had "such overwhelming support from last year's decision," they felt "validated."The move is in response to "Black Friday creep," which sees retailers opening earlier and earlier every year on Thanksgiving to capture crowds for "doorbuster" sales. CBL is marketing its move with the #makeThanksgivingyours hashtag.Retailers that have an exterior entrance in malls will be allowed to open early, however, even if the mall itself is closed until 6 a.m. on Black Friday.



Some retailers, like TJ Maxx, Neiman Marcus, and Costco, have already started announcing whether they will be open or closed on Thanksgiving Day.Here's the full list of CBL malls that will be closed:Acadiana Mall in Lafayette, LouisianaAlamance Crossing in Burlington, North CarolinaArbor Place in Douglasville, GeorgiaAsheville Mall in Asheville, North CarolinaBrookfield Square in Brookfield, WisconsinBurnsville Center in Burnsville, MinnesotaCary Towne Center in Cary, North CarolinaChapel Hills Mall in Colorado Springs, ColoradoCherryVale Mall in Rockford, IllinoisCoastal Grand in Myrtle Beach, South CarolinaCoolSprings Galleria in Franklin, TennesseeCross Creek Mall in Fayetteville, North CarolinaDakota Square Mall in Minot, North DakotaEast Towne Mall in Madison, WisconsinEastGate Mall in Cincinnati, OhioEastland Mall in Bloomington, IllinoisFayette Mall in Lexington, KentuckyFriendly Center in Greensboro, North CarolinaFrontier Mall in Cheyenne, WyomingGreenbrier Mall in Chesapeake, VirginiaHamilton Place in Chattanooga, TennesseeHanes Mall in Winston-Salem, North CarolinaHarford Mall in Bel Air, MarylandHickory Point Mall in Forsyth, IllinoisHoney Creek Mall in Terre Haute, IndianaImperial Valley Mall in El Centro, CaliforniaJanesville Mall in Janesville, WisconsinJefferson Mall in Louisville, KentuckyKirkwood Mall in Bismark, North DakotaLaurel Park Place in Livonia, MichiganLayton Hills Mall in Layton, UtahMall del Norte in Laredo, TexasMayfaire in Wilmington, North CarolinaMeridian Mall in Okemos, MichiganMid Rivers Mall in St. Peters, MissouriMonroeville Mall in Monroeville, PennsylvaniaNorthgate Mall in Chattanooga, TennesseeNorthpark Mall in Joplin, MissouriNorthwoods Mall in Charleston, South CarolinaOak Park Mall in Overland Park, KansasOld Hickory Mall in Jackson, TennesseePark Plaza in Little Rock, ArkansasParkdale Mall in Beaumont, TexasParkway Place in Huntsville, AlabamaPearland Town Center in Pearland, TexasPost Oak Mall in College Station, TexasRichland Mall in Waco, TexasSouth County in St. Louis, MissouriSouthpark Mall in Colonial Heights, VirginiaSt. Clair Square in Fairview Heights, IllinoisStroud Mall, Stroudsburg, PennsylvaniaSunrise Mall, Brownsville in TexasTriangle Town Center in Raleigh, North CarolinaTurtle Creek Mall in Hattiesburg, MississippiValley View Mall in Roanoke, VirginiaVolusia Mall in Daytona Beach, FloridaWest County Center in St. Louis, MissouriWest Park Mall in Giraradeau, MissoriWest Towne Mall in Madison, WisconsinWestGate Mall in Spartanburg, South CarolinaWestmoreland Mall in Greensburg, PennsylvaniaYork Galleria in York, Pennsylvania
