According to adult entertainment site GameLink, the number one best selling title in North Carolina is My TS [Transsexual] Teacher, followed by Shemale Shenanigans, and third is Joey Silvera's Trans-Visions 6. "We have seen significant growth in the viewing of TS movies in North Carolina since 2012," says Jeff Dillon,Vice President of GameLink's parent company, eLine. He adds, "viewing TS movies has increased 64.3 percent [for North Carolina]; our average state increase during this time is 47 percent."AdvertisementIt also seems worth mentioning that, according to GameLink's numbers, Utah downloads the most incest related titles.House Bill 2 was signed into law by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory in early April. The law bans anti-discrimination measures that would protect people from being fired for their sexual orientation or gender presentation. It also outlaws people from using a public restroom that doesn't match the gender on their birth certificate. HB 2 has been characterized as borderline unenforceable by North Carolina police, a last gasp of "prejudice and bigotry" by Bruce Springsteen, and "fucking stupid" by most people who read it. Many trans men took to twitter and Facebook to protest the law, arguing that people who look like them are the last people NC lawmakers want in a women's restroom. But it would appear that the average North Carolinian would be more familiar with the struggle of the trans women in Italian Transsexual Sausage Fest 5-Pack, another popular title on GameLink.Our user data show Mississippi has been consuming gay and transsexual pornography at a high rate in comparison to the rest of the country. It's unfortunate to see that their diverse viewing habits do not translate into an open-minded society.The site also ranks Mississippi sixth in its viewing of gay porn, but number one in hypocrisy. The top five movies watched in Mississippi on GameLink over the last 90 days are Full Service Transsexuals, Fathers and Sons Number 3, Bareback Sex, Daddy and Me, and ever-popular Joey Silvera's Trans-Visions 6."Our user data show Mississippi has been consuming gay and transsexual pornography at a high rate in comparison to the rest of the country," says Dillon. "It's unfortunate to see that their diverse viewing habits do not translate into an open-minded society."Mississippi House Bill 1532 was signed into law April 5. In it, marriage is defined as between one man and one woman, and insists that "male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual's immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth"—a laughably useless set of criteria which doesn't take into account the one in 1400 people born outside of XX and XY chromosomal typing, and the one in 100 people born with bodies that do not have "standard" male/female genitalia (according to the Intersex Society of North America).One can view the high consumption of gay porn in Mississippi and trans porn in North Carolina as hypocritical, but an argument also could be made that the hypersexualization of trans bodies directly correlates with perceiving them as a threat. A sexy, sexy threat. Why, any minute now we could be ravished by a dashing trans man named Slaven with salt and pepper hair, and a smile like a secret, and the secret is that he loves you.Governor McCrory signed an executive order on April 12, preventing state employees from being fired for being gay or trans, while keeping the most controversial bathroom-related parts of the bill. In a video, he said that North Carolina is "a state that strives to allow our people and business to as independent as possible, without overreaching government regulations." He neglected to mention whether his newfound softening on the issue was because of backlash from entities like the ACLU and Paypal, or the humanizing effect of films like My Girlfriend's Cock 17.Tagged:House Bill 2MISSISSIPPInorth carolinaPat McCroryLGBT+LGBTQporntransgenderBroadly SexFeminismeSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.AdvertisementAboutCareers at VICEVICE VoicesPartnerVICE Canada Website Terms and ConditionsPolitical Ads RegistryAccessibility Statement© 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP
